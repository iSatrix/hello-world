About me:
Josh, here!  I completed my bachelor's degree in Software Development at Western Governors University in November 2021.  I have also done some work through FreeCodeCamp learning Full Stack Web Development prior to my time at WGU.  I am a father of 3, 1 girl and 2 boys, and have been happily married since February 14th, 2014.  When I have free time I enjoy playing videogames.  My top game since 2014 has been Destiny 2, but I am also a big fan of The Elder Scrolls Online as well as the single player entries (special shout out to TESIII: Morrowind).  In early 2022 I began working on my own Android app called Chores For Scores.  I am building this app to further grow my software development experience while looking for my first job.  It has been immensely fun to work on and I often feel like I am making large strides as a developer while working on it.  I am aiming to have the app released on Google Play sometime in 2023.

Now that I have completed my degree I have begun taking several courses from Udemy to learn the following:
  - Spring Framework
  - Maven
  - RESTful API
  - SOAP Web Services
  

Java is my first language, but I have also worked with the following:
  - HTML5/CSS3
  - JavaScript
  - C++
  - SQL
  - Python


My IDE of choice is IntelliJ.  Here are some others that I have experience with:
  - NetBeans 8.2
  - Eclipse
  - Visual Studio 2019
  - Visual Studio Code
  - AndroidStudio
  - Apache NetBeans IDE 12.0


Other miscellaneous programs I have used to help me code:
  - SceneBuilder
  - Notepad+
  - MySQL Workbench 8.0 CE
