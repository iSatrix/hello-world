Hello World!

Josh here.  I am currently learning Software Development at Western Governors University.  I have also done some work through FreeCodeCamp learning Full Stack Web Development.

Java is my first language, but I have also worked with the following:
  - HTML5/CSS3
  - JavaScript
  - C++
  - SQL
  - Python


My IDE of choice has been NetBeans IDE 8.2 for many years.  This may be due to the fact that it was the first IDE I was exposed to.  I have used several others but always find myself gravitating back to NetBeans.  Here are some others that I have had experience with:
  - Eclipse
  - Visual Studio 2019
  - Visual Studio Code
  - AndroidStudio
  - Apache NetBeans IDE 12.0


Other miscellaneous programs I have used to help me code:
  - SceneBuilder
  - Notepad+
  - MySQL Workbench 8.0 CE
